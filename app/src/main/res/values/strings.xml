    <string name="storyline">In mid-20s New York, Newt Scamander, the British young activist wizard,
        arrives in town, holding a mysterious leather suitcase which shelters a wide array of diverse
        and magical creatures that exist among us. Amid an already fragile equilibrium of secrecy,
        and the increasing disasters ascribed to the dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald, Newt\'s precious
        suitcase will be lost--and to make matters worse--several creatures will manage to escape.
        Before long, this situation will catch Senior Auror Percival Graves\' attention who will target
        Newt, in the background of an invisible, devastating, and utterly unpredictable menace that still
        wreaks havoc on 5th Avenue. In the end, is there a hidden agenda behind Graves\' intentions; moreover,
        what will happen to the remaining fantastic beasts still loose in the streets?
    -------------
        It opens in 1926 as Newt Scamander has just completed a global excursion to find and document an
        extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have
        come and gone without incident, were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced
        magical case, and the escape of some of Newt's fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the
        wizarding and No-Maj worlds.
